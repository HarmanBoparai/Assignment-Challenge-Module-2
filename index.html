<p> 
     I did Masters in Tech.(Software Systems).I developed a diverse skill set through my educational and work experience.Front-end development satisfies my need for creativity.
     It enabled me to easily put my ideas into digital form and get results back really quick. I still remember the first time I created an HTML page and opened it in the browser.
     A whole new world of possibilities appeared before my eyes.I became really passionate and kept creating since then. 
     It absolutely has its ups and downs but if you love what you do and are able to provide value to people, the outcomes are far more rewarding.</p>
